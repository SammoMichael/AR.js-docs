It is a ratio between the physical size of the marker, and the resolution of the camera image.\nIt is a tradeoff: the larger the camera image, the slower it is running.\nThe larger the camera image, the smaller the marker can be.\nHow to Run AR.js Locally\nTo run AR.js locally on your computer, first clone a copy of the repository, and change to the AR.js folder:\n  git clone git@github.com:jeromeetienne/AR.js.git\n  cd AR.js\nAfter that, serve the files using a static http server.  I use a simple command line http server called http-server.\nThis can be installed using npm:\n  npm install -g http-server\nto start the http-server, simply run:\n  http-server\nCan't access user media error\nOn mobile, accessing the camera using getUserMedia requires that you have a secure HTTPS connection to the server.  To do this, you will need to generate a certificate by running:\n  openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem\nThis will generate two files: key.pem and cert.pem.\nYou then run the server with the -S to enable SSL and -C for your certificate files:\n  http-server -S -C cert.pem -o\nAlternatively, you can deploy to github pages which by default, is served using HTTPS.  This avoids having to configure a SSL server.\nAlso working from localhost, you can avoid having to use HTTPS since localhost is assumed secured.\nThanks to @mritzco for configuration directions.\nWhich plateform is Supported ?\nit works on any browser with WebRTC and WebGL.\nIt run on platforms: android, IOS and window mobile.\nAs experimentation, it has been on \nhtc vive by @robenghuse \nand hololens by @evhan55.\nWhat is interested is that i didn't change a line to run on those devices.

Let's see how to use it.  \nShow Dont Tell\n\nToday you can make\naugmented reality in 10 Lines of HTML, isn't the web amazing ?\nIt is really that simple, you can try live on codepen.\nJust put a hiro marker in front\nof the camera and we will add the augmented reality on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nIn this scene, the camera is being moved by AR.js, and \nthe origin of your scene is at the center of the marker. \nAll the rest is normal a-frame. \nSo if you want to add new objects in the augmented reality, just add it \nnear the .\nAdd Augmented Reality in your A-Frame Project\n\nTo include AR.js, you need to include aframe-ar.js.\nThen you initialize ar.js in .\n\n\nThen you tell aframe that you want arjs to control the camera. For that, you just add\n\n\nDon't forget to add the body style and a-scene embedded attribute. And you are ALL DONE 😄\nPersonalize your AR Content\nNow we have a basic cube in AR...\nIt would be good to personalise the AR a bit. Let's see how to add a text, an image or even your \nown model in augmented reality.\n\nOne of the most asked questions has been \"how to load my own model in AR?\".\nAs I said before, ar.js controls the displacement of the camera, all the rest\nis classic a-frame. So you can load a model exactly as you would in \na-frame. \nHere is an example of loading a gltf model, just add that in your a-scene.\nFor more detail see a-frame documentation about models.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nAnother way to easily personalize your AR is to put a text or an image on top.\nTo add a text, simply just use a-text as below.\n\n\nTo add an image, a-image is easy. Just paste this in your a-frame scene.\n\n\nCustomize your Marker\n\nWe understand that many people want to personalize the marker. It is possible to replace the Hiro pattern with your own image, as long as it is inside the black border.\nWe have provided an easy way to this. It is called the marker generator.\nWe even wrote a whole step by step post to help you get started. \nFirst, you upload your own image and generate a pattern file pattern-marker.patt.\nSecond, you download the trained marker. And third, potentially print your marker.\nWe provide a PDF file to make it easier for you.\nWhat to do with the generated pattern file?\nThis file contains the encoded marker that you should reuse in your code.\nYou specify you want a pattern marker and you provide the url to your own marker. \nSo in our case  should be replaced by the following.\n\n\nSimple enough.\nDifferent Type of Markers : Pattern and Barcode\nUp to now, we use the 'pattern' marker. But AR.js supports another kind of marker, called barcode.\nEach of those markers contains a kind of binary code which encodes a number.\nFor example below, you see one representing 5.\n\nBarcode markers may be very useful for various type of applications, especially when you have many locations with various markers.\nFor example, \nMarcel Freinbichler and Lisi Linhart\nwanted to do a augmented reality application for their school: \"When you go to a room, you point your phone and it shows you in augmented reality the availability of this room.\"\nSo they chosed to use barcode markers: one barcode per room. Thus when the AR application sees the marker, it converts that to into a number which matches the room. So you do a xmlhttprequest to get the current schedule of the room and display it on top of the marker. \nI love this idea! It is useful for other people in the school. It has nice panash with AR. But most of all, it provides relevant informations directly where and when needed. This is a key principle for AR applications.\nAdd Barcode Marker in Your Project\nTo add them in your project is rather straight forward.\nFirst you need to tell AR.js to start detecting them and their type of \nbinary code. So you modify a-scene as below.\n\n\nNow that ar.js knows you want to use barcode markers, on each of your marker\nyou need to specify which number you will use, e.g. for barcode 5.\n\n\nHere is barcode marker generator to generate your own. Up to you to use the type of matrix code matches you need.\nSometimes such configurations may be painful so to simplify common cases, we used preset.\nMarkers Presets for Easier Configuration\nTo make it easier and to avoid repeating ourselves, \nit is possible to have preset to configure your markers. \nCurrently there are 2 presets \"hiro\" and \"kanji\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove the Camera or the Marker ?\nWhen handling augmented reality, you need to decide if you want the \n3d world origin to be the camera or the marker. Most people will use\nthe marker as origin because it is more intuitive. Let's see the details\nof each mode.\nIn one mode, you use . In this mode, the camera is moving and the marker is static, fixed at 0,0,0.\nThis way to work is more common for 3d programmers, so it is the one I use in most examples.\n\n\nIn the other mode, you use .\nIt behaves the other way around: the camera is static at all times while the objects or markers are moving.\nThe camera is fixed at 0,0,0 at all times and looks toward negative-z.\nNevertheless this mode got a limitation, it can't handle multiple independent markers at once.\nSo if you have multiple markers and want to handle them independently from each other \ne.g. like in this video.\nYou will need to use , and a simple camera instead. \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\nHow to handle multiple distinct markers\nNow that we have seen various possibilities of AR.js,\nlet's end with a last example of multiple distinct markers. Those can be useful in various applications\ne.g. a 'measure it' like below.\nSo we will have 3 markers, one with a preset, one with a custom pattern marker, and a barcode.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n    \n\n\nConclusion\nIn this post we have seen how to do efficient Augmented Reality with AR.js, and how to add it to your A-Frame project. \nWe now know how to customize content in AR and make it more personal. \nWe've also learned that it's possible to create your own marker with an easy-to-use marker generator.\nFinally, we've learned how to handle the camera and use multiple distinct markers. \nThis is a lot! Congrats on getting to the end without quitting ;)\nI hope you all start creating amazing things with AR.js and A-Frame. Don't forget it's open source, so your imagination is the limit! \nThanks for reading.
